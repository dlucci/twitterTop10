twitterTop10
This program will take as input a twitter handle and then will print out the top 10 most tweeted words from that account.  I ported this program from a command line ruby program to a sinatra web application.  It has a few bugs that I am still trying to work out, most notably, making a 404 page as well as handling a non existant handle.
